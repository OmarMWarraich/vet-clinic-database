# Vet clinic database

> This is a database for a vet clinic. It contains information about animals, owners, and vets.

## Tools used:

- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Pre-requisites

- node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL
